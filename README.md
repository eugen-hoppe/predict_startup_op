# Startups Operations/Close Predictions

This is a Data Science/Machine Learning project developed for educational purposes, aiming to predict the closure of start-ups.

## Overview

The project involves building a machine learning pipeline designed to process various types of features, including numerical, categorical, and ordinal. The pipeline addresses common data challenges such as missing values and feature scaling, and it includes a hyperparameter tuning process to optimize model performance. Additionally, the project incorporates fine-tuning of the model threshold to further enhance predictive accuracy.

### Conclusion

The project successfully developed a robust machine learning pipeline capable of effectively handling data preprocessing and model training. Through thorough hyperparameter tuning and strategic threshold adjustment, the model was optimized to achieve a high F1 score. The RandomForest model, configured with the best-performing hyperparameters, demonstrated strong and consistent performance across both training and test datasets.

The feature importance analysis highlighted key features such as `til_last_fund`, `last1st_index`, and `root_years`, which played a significant role in the model's predictive success. This insight provides valuable guidance for further refinement and enhancement of the model.

In summary, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of a well-structured machine learning pipeline in predicting the closure of start-ups, with the potential for application in real-world scenarios where precise and reliable predictions are critical.
